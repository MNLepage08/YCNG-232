# YCNG-232: Natural Language Processing Fundamentals

## :rocket: Assignments
1. [Token, Stop words, Distribution of Term Frequency, Word Cloud on book selected on web: ](https://github.com/MNLepage08/YCNG-232/blob/main/Week_1_LSI.ipynb)Retrieve a book from the web. Estimate the number of sentences/paragraphs/names (places and people) it contains. Select the ten most frequent words in the text as stop words. Identify potential stop words for documents written in a non-speaking language. Shape distribution with histogram of word frequencies. Visualize the word cloud.<p>
2. [TF-IDF distribution, Topic detection with LDA, Detection of stop words with TF-IDF on corpus: ](https://github.com/MNLepage08/YCNG-232/blob/main/Week_2_R.ipynb)Collection of the Jane Austen corpus. Visualization of word length / TF-IDF distribution. Computation of a document/word similarity measure based on Tf-Idf matrix. Topic detection using the LDA method. Topic visualization using word clouds and treemaps. Detection of stop words with the TF-IDF method.<p>
